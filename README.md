## Features
- Play the Wordle-inspired word guessing game in private chats or group chats.
- Supports multiplayer gameplay in groups, with admin tools for game management.
- Keep track of scores with group and global leaderboards.
- Commands to view personal scores and leaderboard rankings filtered by time (today, week, month, etc.).
- Flexible game settings: customizable limits for attempts and group admin permissions.

## How to Play
1. **Start a game**: Use the `/new` command in a group or private chat.
2. **Guess the word**: Players try to guess a random 5-letter word.
3. **Hints after each guess**:
   - 🟩 - Correct letter in the right spot.
   - 🟨 - Correct letter in the wrong spot.
   - 🟥 - Letter not in the word.
4. The game ends when:
   - The word is correctly guessed, or
   - Maximum number of guesses (30) is reached.
5. The first person to guess the word correctly wins!

## Commands
- **/new** - Start a new game.
- **/end** - End the current game (admins only in group chats).
- **/help** - Get help with commands and game rules.
- **/leaderboard** - View leaderboards for the group or globally. Example:
  ```
  /leaderboard global week
  ```
- **/myscore** - View your score. Example:
  ```
  /myscore group all
  ```
- **/stats** - View bot usage stats (admin users only).

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- Bun.js Runtime (or Node.js)
- Telegram Bot Token (create one via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis server (for caching and session management)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/binamralamsal/WordSeek
   cd WordSeek
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
   DATABASE_URI=your-postgresql-database-url
   NODE_ENV=development
   REDIS_URI=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   Run the database migrations to set up the required tables:
   ```bash
   bun run migrate
   ```

5. **Start the bot**:
   - **Development mode** (with hot reload):
     ```bash
     bun run dev
     ```
   - **Production mode**:
     ```bash
     bun run start
     ```

### Additional Database Commands
- **Generate new migrations** (after schema changes):
  ```bash
  bun run generate
  ```
- **Open database studio** (for database management):
  ```bash
  bun run studio
  ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and ensure they follow the project's coding standards.
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly in development mode.
5. **Commit your changes** with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: new feature description"
   ```
6. **Push to your fork** and **open a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

### Development Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Add appropriate error handling for new features.
- Update documentation for any new commands or features.
- Test both private chat and group chat functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database connection errors**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the `DATABASE_URI` is correct.
